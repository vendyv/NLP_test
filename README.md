# NLP_test
Repository to use Natural Language Processing to analyze the reviews of a certain restaurant.
The classification methods are used to train the reviews as positive or negative as per the given dataset.
Evaluation of the algorithm is carried out using confusion metrics.

Classification algorithms used:
1. Logistic Regression
2. K-Nearest Neighbors
3. Gaussian Naive Bayes
4. Support Vector Classification
5. Kernel - SVM
6. Decision Tree Classification
7. Random Forest Classification

Evaluation parameters calculated for the test set:
1. Accuracy
2. Precision
3. Recall
4. F1 Score
